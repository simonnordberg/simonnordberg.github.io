  <h2>More about me</h2>
  <p>
    I have spent the past 20 years in software development in various roles and environments. I have started several
    companies. I have been a startup CTO. I have been an individual contributor and a manager. I have been a consultant
    working with companies in a wide range of industries. I have worked in product companies and agencies. If I am to go
    by the feedback I get; I am a trusted leader with strong people and strategic leadership skills.
  </p>
  <p>
    I love learning and improving. I have come to acknowledge this as one of my core qualities. I am
    able to quickly get up to speed and be productive in a new environment.

  <p>
    Personally, I am a devoted trail and ultra runner, downhill skier, occasional DJ and self-improvement nerd.
