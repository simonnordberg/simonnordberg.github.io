April 2021
===
What am I most obsessively focused on for the foreseeable future? In no particular order:

- Buying a house. Haven't moved yet.
- Recovering from COVID that I tested positive for back in December 2020.
- Getting back to [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/26672410) and a slightly more structured [training plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C6kI-71EpqCNhQtRsy4kElkjy1uvSkKkk5I9To0X_aw/edit). 
- Building technology products at [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/).
