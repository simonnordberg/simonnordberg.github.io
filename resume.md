  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    I am an engineer and technology generalist turned product leader who thrives on defining successful products,
    building
    effective product teams, and improving product development processes.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have spent the past 20 years in software development in a wide range of roles ranging from engineering and product
    individual contributor to CTO in product centric engineering driven organizations. What's been consistent is my
    passion for continuously improving the principles and practices to enable product teams to get on with what they do
    best. I am all about intent to action. I love the process of incrementally delivering value in a pragmatic way.
  </p>
  <p>
    Personally, I am a devoted trail and ultra runner, downhill skier, occasional DJ and self-improvement nerd.
